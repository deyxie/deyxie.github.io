Analysis shows that the recognition requires fast response time and edge calculation, and low mAP is acceptable if the binary judgment is accurate enough. Collected data from cameras and used LabelImg from Github to label the images and resize to 300x300. After data augment, the dataset finally has 4 classes and about 3000 images each class. And transfer them into TFrecords. SSD-300(VGG-based) is Used to detect the safety equipment. Train the model in tensorflow2.1.0 but the loss was not convergent. The reason is in loss function the denominator should be the number of the positive labels and negative labels, but I mistakenly used batch size as the denominator. The model can draw the boundaries of the helmet, reflective vest, insulating gloves and insulating boots. I defined the recognition as valid when the map is greater than 50%. The recall score is 0.88 and the speed is 43fps on my single GPU (Nvidia 2070s) machine. 2.Traffic Targets Detection Based on Deep Learning Duration: 09/2017-01/2018 Role: Postgraduate student Organization: Institute of Transportation System Science and Engineering (TSE) Cooperation: Beijing Jiaotong University The research goal of this project is to use deep learning object detection algorithms to identify and track pedestrians, cars, traffic signs and other common targets (13 classes totally) on roads. Collected photos by Python web crawler and camera to expand the VOC2007 and VOC2012 dataset. Enhanced the dataset by rotating, flipping, and adjusting exposure of the photos by a Python lib named Albumentations. Improved the accuracy and speed of feature extraction net, which is GoogLeNet, by adding Space Pyramid Pooling, Depthwise Separable Convolutions and Batch Normalization, and trained it with the enhanced database. Took the improved GoogleNet as the basenet for Faster RCNN and YOLO V2. Adjusted parameters such as Anchor Size, and hyper-parameters such as Learning Rate, Batch Size through experimental comparison to obtain result optimization. Using the captured video to verify on my experimental server. Compared with the original Faster RCNN, the optimized network has improved mAP by 1.9%, increased processing speed by 8 fps. Compared with the original YOLO V2, the optimized network is in mAP Increased by 3.1%, and increased by 4 fps in processing speed. 3.Nuclei Segmentation in Digital Pathology Using Deep Machine Learning Duration: 06/2017-09/2017 Role: Postgraduate student Organization: Department of Computer Science Cooperation: University of Birmingham Exploited deep learning to identify breast cancer nuclei. Used Matlab to split the original image dataset, generated 1.2 million 32x32 patches with labels (0-the most central pixel is non-nuclei, 1-the most central pixel is nuclei), and grouped them by 5-fold cross validation. Implemented Alexnet and VGGNet in Tensorflow and classified each pixel with sliding window and small patches. Achieved a pixel level nuclear identification rate (recall rate) of 88%+ through VGG and Alexnet models. Proposed improved sensory field (1x1 improved to 2x2), and the performance of pixel level classification is improved without the increase of calculation cost, the identification rate increased 4%. 4.Brain MRI Data Diagnosis Based on K-means algorithm Duration: 06/2017-09/2017 Role: Postgraduate student Organization: Department of Computer Science Cooperation: University of Birmingham Exploited deep learning to identify breast cancer nuclei.

Gained deeper knowledge on the business thinking pattern of solving problems, saving costs and win-win conceptions.","title":"Project 1:Wuhan intelligent vehicle and automatic driving test field"},{"location":"work_exp/#china-unicom-research-institute","text":"Duration: 01/2018-04/2018 Role: Big Data Developer at Data Center(Intership)","title":"China Unicom Research Institute"},{"location":"work_exp/#project-1wuhan-intelligent-vehicle-and-automatic-driving-test-field_1","text":"Responsible for analyzing the reason of user leaving. Learned and used Hive and Hive SQL to query and calculate data in HDFS. Adopted PCA to identify the most influential variables on the variance of the data and used density-based clustering to these variables to find out the common features of the users that changed their telecom operators. Employed K-means algorithm to conduct preliminary tests, and concluded a strong positive correlation between operator change and factors such as service matching, mobile phone replacement and regional changes on the basis of the obtained data.","title":"Project 1:Wuhan intelligent vehicle and automatic driving test field"}]}
